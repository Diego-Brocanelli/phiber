Criador [MÃ¡rcio Lucas]

> I made this library to increase my knowledge and to help my friends programmers build apps in PHP more fast, cause I see an big difficulty to build SQLs and i think very boring. 

This library are in alpha test, I don't recommend to production environments.

### Technology

Phiber uses just pure PHP and until now only has been builded the part to MySQL 5.5+.
*In the next versions we will implement in BDs like PostgreSQL and Oracle.



### Installation

Phiber requires  PHP 5.3.3+ to run and MySQL 5.5+.

Installing Phiber in your project.

You can install by two ways. First is making the Download from github repository and putting the folder of your project
The second way is installing via composer with this command bellow:

```

### Config

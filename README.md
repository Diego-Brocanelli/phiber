Criador [MÃ¡rcio Lucas]

> I made this library to increase my knowledge and to help my friends programmers build apps in PHP more fast, cause I see an big difficulty to build SQLs and i think it is very boring. 

This library are in alpha test, I don't recommend to production environments.

Phiber uses just pure PHP and until now only has been builded the part to MySQL 5.5+.
*In the next versions we will implement in BDs like PostgreSQL and Oracle.
